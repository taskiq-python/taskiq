## What is taskiq in a nutshell

Consider taskiq as an asyncio celery implementation. It uses almost the same patterns, but it's more modern
and flexible.

It's not a drop-in replacement for any other task manager. It has a different ecosystem of libraries and a different set of features.
Also, it doesn't work for synchronous projects. You won't be able to send tasks synchronously.


## Installation

You can install taskiq with pip or your favorite dependency manager:

```bash:no-line-numbers
pip install taskiq
```
