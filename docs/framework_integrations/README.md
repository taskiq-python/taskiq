# Framework integrations

Taskiq is meant to be simple and adaptive. That's why we try to add different integrations to make development with taskiq and your favorite framework easy and fun!

Integrations with frameworks add two things:
1. Startup and Shutdown events;
1. Dependencies to use in your handler.
