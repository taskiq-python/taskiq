# Available schedule sources

These objects are used to fetch current schedule for tasks.

## Official schedule sources

These schedule sources are not part of the core Taskiq library. But they are maintained by Taskiq developers. You can install them as a separate package.

### RedisScheduleSource

This source is capable of adding new schedules in runtime. It uses Redis as a storage for schedules.
To use this source you need to install `taskiq-redis` package.

```python
from taskiq_redis import RedisScheduleSource

from taskiq import TaskiqScheduler

redis_source = RedisScheduleSource("redis://localhost:6379/0")
scheduler = TaskiqScheduler(broker, sources=[redis_source])
```

For more information on how to use dynamic schedule sources read [Dynamic scheduling section](../guide/scheduling-tasks.md#dynamic-scheduling).


### LabelScheduleSource

This source parses labels of tasks, and if it finds a `schedule` label, it considers this task as scheduled.

The format of the schedule label is the following:

```python
@broker.task(
    schedule=[
        {
            "cron": "*/1 * * * *", # type: str, either cron or time should be specified.
            "cron_offset": None # type: str | timedelta | None, can be omitted.
            "time": None  # type: datetime | None, either cron or time should be specified.
            "args": [], # type List[Any] | None, can be omitted.
            "kwargs": {}, # type: Dict[str, Any] | None, can be omitted.
            "labels": {}, # type: Dict[str, Any] | None, can be omitted.
            "schedule_id": "every_minute",  # type: str | None, can be omitted.
        }
    ]
)
async def my_task():
    ...
```

Parameters:

- `cron` - crontab string when to run the task.
- `cron_offset` - timezone offset for cron values. Explained [here](../guide/scheduling-tasks.md#working-with-timezones)
- `time` - specific time when send the task.
- `args` - args to use, when invoking the task.
- `kwargs` - key-word arguments to use when invoking the task.
- `labels` - additional labels to use when invoking the task.
- `schedule_id` - unique identifier of the schedule. If not specified, a random uuid will be generated.

To enable this source, just add it to the list of sources:

```python
from taskiq.scheduler import TaskiqScheduler
from taskiq.schedule_sources import LabelScheduleSource

broker = ...

scheduler = TaskiqScheduler(
    broker=broker,
    sources=[LabelScheduleSource(broker)],
)
```

::: warning Cool notice!

In order to resolve all labels correctly, don't forget to import
all task modules using CLI interface.

:::

### NATS schedule source

This source is capable of adding new schedules in runtime. It uses NATS as a storage for schedules.
To use this source you need to install `taskiq-nats` package.

```python
from taskiq_nats import NATSKeyValueScheduleSource
from taskiq.scheduler import TaskiqScheduler


broker = ...

scheduler = TaskiqScheduler(
    broker=broker,
    sources=[NATSKeyValueScheduleSource(broker)],
)
```

This schedule source doesn't use `schedule` label on tasks. To add new schedules, you need to call `add_schedule` method on the source.

## Third-party schedule sources

These schedule sources are not part of the core Taskiq library. They are maintained by other openâ€‘source contributors. You can install them as a separate packages.

### PostgreSQL schedule source
