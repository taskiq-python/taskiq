Taskiq is a fully asynchronous distributed task queue.

This project takes inspiration from big projects such as [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev) and [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/).
But taskiq can send and run both the sync and async functions.
Also, we use [PEP-612](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) to provide the best autosuggestions possible. But since it's a new PEP, I encourage you to use taskiq with VS code because Pylance understands all types correctly.
