# Brokers

To add a new broker you need to implement two methods `kick` and `listen` of the `taskiq.abc.broker.AsyncBroker` abstract class.
But along with them we have helper methods. Such as shutdown and startup.

Here is a template for new brokers:

@[code python](../examples/extending/broker.py)

## Conventions

For brokers, we have several conventions. It's good if your broker implements them.
These rules are optional, and it's ok if your broker doesn't implement them.

1. If the message has the `delay` label with int or float number, this task's `execution` must be delayed
   with the same number of seconds as in the delay label.
2. If the message has the `priority` label, this message must be sent with priority. Tasks with
   higher priorities are executed sooner.
